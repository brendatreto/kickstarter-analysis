# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of project
### Purpose
Louise, an aspiring playwright, wants help planning a successful crowdfunding campaign. Analyzing this data will help her identify factors that could make her campaign a success and avoid any possible mistakes. In this project we will help Louise determine the role that factors such as the the type of project, launch date, goal and lenght, play in the outcome. The given data encompasses important information, but without the proper analysis it has little to no use.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For the first part of the analysis we tried to find the relationship between the launch date and the outcome of the campaing. In order to do this we did the following:
1. Created a column to get a better visualization of the year the campaign was launched.
2. Created a pivot table to filter by category and year and see the way it relates to the outcome of the campaing. By doing this, we extracted the data we were interested in and saw how it correlated.
3. We filtered the infomation by choosing the theater category and sorting the outcome in descending order

4. To continue the analysis, we made a chart to visualize the relationship between outcome and the month the campaing was launched.

5. This line chart was helpful to discover trends based on months. Have we used a different chart (pie or bar), we would not have been able to discern pattern in the behavior of campaigns over the year.
After this process was completed we found out that:
* Campaigns launched on May have higher success rates than those launched on December.
* Campaigns launched on October have a hight tendency of failure.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
